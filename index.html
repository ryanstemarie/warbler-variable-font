                  Warbler is a variable font that was designed by David Jonathan Ross in 2022.               
                  The font took a lot of  inspiration from the style of type cuts made for the font
                  Bulmer which was created in 1790 and used mainly for the publications of poems and the works of William Shakespeare.  Bulmer seemed to bridge the gap between Baskerville and Bodoni, which made Ross start to fall in love with this style of transitional typeface that took a gentle approach to the Modern serif. Ross wanted to tap into the stylistic choices of Bulmer which included small subtle gestures that would grow on you after awhile. He included this in Warbler by adding unique cuts, curves, and bends into the letterforms that don’t follow traditional standards of similar typefaces.
                  The font is meant to show a soft and gentle side without adding too much decoration and takes inspiration from both the type cuts of the late 1700s and the stylistic choices of natural specimen books of the same time period. Warbler is a variable font and can change by weight or optical size, with more of a focus on the optical sizing options. These sizing changes add subtle, but strong variations to proportion, contrast, and scale, while keeping a unique delicate theme to the typeface. Warbler is designed for extended reading, with an emphasis on the screen.
